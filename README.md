## Description

This is a basic User Management System project made for the tech test of InterNations.

### Technologies

- Next: provides me performance, caching, and easy configuration.
- Typescript: provides me productivity, and trustability.
- Styled-components: provides me the power of Typescript in CSS without losing the CSS syntax and in a Clean Code way.
- Zod: has a good integration with next and typescript.
- ESLint: provides me a good balance between clean code and productivity, also giving trustability.
- Json-server: just to simulate a backend and make it more realistic.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

In this project, we use json-server. So to install it:

```bash
npm install -g json-server
```

Then, create a db.json file with some data (I've leave a example in the repository, but feel free to change it).

Now, run the server
```bash
json-server --watch db.json --port 3004
```
Don't forget to run it in the port 3004 by using the "--port 3004" flag, because our frontend is using the port 3000.

Then run the development frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
